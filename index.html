                        But it only does that because I coded it in as you were moving your mouse to try it and you would have never known 
                        that this is just some arbitrary text which I'm interactively modifying at the will of your own mind. Arbitrarily stumbling
                        upon this website led to the placement of arbitrary text and you arbitrarily read the text and assigned it the function to <em><q>enlargeOnMouseOver</q></em>
                        with more arbitrary thoughts which were placed into my arbitrary nueral network which is connected to the nueral netowrk which arbitrarily happens to control
                        your body. Your brain. Arbitrarily added these functions. Oh did you notice that for some reason your mouse has a lot of power here? ... Arb- just kidding
                        <br> weird.. <span class="hiddenUntilMouseOver"> You thought I'd say it... hah... well... I did!!! <span class="enlargeOnMouseOver">ARBITRARY!</span>
